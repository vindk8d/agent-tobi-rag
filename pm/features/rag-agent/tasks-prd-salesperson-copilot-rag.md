# Task List: Salesperson Copilot Agent with RAG

Based on PRD: `prd-salesperson-copilot-rag.md`

## ðŸŽ¯ Agent Design Principle

**Keep agent logic simple yet effective** - The goal is to achieve the needed functionalities with as little complexity as needed to keep our agent effective, lightweight and traceable. Prioritize clarity over complexity.

### Notes

- Use LangChain's modular architecture with separate components for loaders, splitters, and retrievers
- Implement LangGraph's state-based agent design for conversation management
- Follow Supabase best practices for vector embeddings and RLS policies
- Integrate LangSmith from the beginning for comprehensive tracing
- Use Next.js 14 app router for modern React patterns
- **Website Scraping Deprioritized:** Due to complexity of data gathering, HTML/JS parsing, and scraping methodologies, focus on document upload as primary data source
- **Dependency Management**: Heavy dependencies (~~Playwright~~, Telegram bot) were removed from initial requirements.txt to optimize build times. They will be added back when their respective tasks are started (see task-specific notes).
