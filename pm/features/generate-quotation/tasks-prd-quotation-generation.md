### Notes

- WeasyPrint requires specific HTML/CSS structure for professional PDF output
- Supabase storage integration should follow existing document upload patterns
- HITL flows must integrate with existing request_approval() and request_input() patterns
- Database helper functions should be reusable across multiple tools
- Tests should cover both successful flows and error scenarios
- **CRITICAL**: HITL resume logic is required for proper agent architecture compliance (identified in evaluation_generate_quotation_hitl.md)
- **NEW**: Enhanced quotation flow introduces pre-approval step before PDF generation to improve customer experience
- **NEW**: Information correction handling requires LLM-based intent detection and multi-stage processing
- **NEW**: Completeness assessment must be simple and straightforward - avoid complex scoring or over-collection
- **NEW**: State management becomes more complex with correction history and multi-step approval processes
- **NEW**: All correction and pre-approval flows must preserve existing HITL helper function usage patterns
- **NEW**: Performance optimization critical for correction detection - use keyword filtering before LLM calls

## Key Changes Made to Task 7.6 (Enhanced Clean UX with Optional Information)

**ENHANCED USER EXPERIENCE:**
- **Added**: Comprehensive information display with required and optional sections
- **Enhanced**: Clean customer/vehicle confirmation with complete data visibility
- **Focus**: Accuracy confirmation for required fields + optional information review/addition
- **Logic**: Approval step shows all available information (required + optional) when completeness validation passes

**OPTIONAL INFORMATION DISPLAY:**
- **Customer Details**: Company, address (in addition to required name, email/phone)
- **Vehicle Details**: Year, color, type, quantity (in addition to required make, model)
- **Purchase Information**: Financing, trade-in, delivery timeline, payment method
- **Timeline Information**: Urgency, decision timeline, delivery date
- **Contact Preferences**: Preferred method, best time, follow-up frequency

**REVOLUTIONARY: AUTOMATIC LLM-BASED CORRECTIONS VIA DECORATOR:**
- **Enhanced @hitl_recursive_tool Decorator**: Automatic LLM correction processing built into existing decorator
- **Zero Tool Changes**: Existing tools get corrections automatically - no code changes required
- **Natural Language Understanding**: LLM understands corrections like "change customer to John", "make it red"
- **Automatic Parameter Mapping**: LLM intelligently maps corrections and re-calls tools with updated parameters
- **Transparent Corrections**: Tools never see correction logic - decorator handles everything automatically
- **Universal Capability**: Any tool using @hitl_recursive_tool gets corrections for free
- **Pure Business Logic**: Tools focus only on business logic - no HITL complexity
- **LangGraph Integration**: Seamless integration with existing interrupt/resume and state management
- **Complete Elimination**: Removes all tool-specific correction handlers and resume logic
- **Universal Migration**: Comprehensive audit and migration of all existing tools to use decorator
- **Conflict Resolution**: Identifies and removes conflicting correction logic from all tools
- **Ultimate Simplification**: Most elegant solution - corrections become completely invisible to tools

**INTERNAL COMPLETENESS LOGIC:**
- **Maintained**: Existing QuotationContextIntelligence completeness assessment system
- **Usage**: Internal decision making, logging, analytics, system optimization only
- **No User Display**: Completeness status kept behind the scenes for better UX

**ENHANCED FLOW LOGIC:**
1. **Completeness Check** (internal) → If fails: HITL for missing info (existing flow)
2. **If passes**: Enhanced approval step → Required + Optional information display → PDF generation
3. **Corrections**: Handled within same approval step, support all field types, regenerate and re-approve

**BENEFITS:**
- **Complete Information Visibility**: Employees see all available data for better quotations
- **Flexible Correction System**: Can correct/add any information (required or optional)
- **Better Business Value**: More complete quotations with comprehensive customer data
- **Maintains Simplicity**: Single approval step with enhanced information display
- **Solves Original UX Problem**: Prevents defaulting to wrong customers while showing complete picture
