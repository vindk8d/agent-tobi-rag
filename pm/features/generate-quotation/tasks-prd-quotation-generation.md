### Notes

- WeasyPrint requires specific HTML/CSS structure for professional PDF output
- Supabase storage integration should follow existing document upload patterns
- HITL flows must integrate with existing request_approval() and request_input() patterns
- Database helper functions should be reusable across multiple tools
- Tests should cover both successful flows and error scenarios
- **CRITICAL**: HITL resume logic is required for proper agent architecture compliance (identified in evaluation_generate_quotation_hitl.md)

## Tasks
