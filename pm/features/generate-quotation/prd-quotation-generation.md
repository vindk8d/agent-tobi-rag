# Product Requirements Document: AI Agent Quotation Generation System

## Introduction/Overview

The AI Agent Quotation Generation System enables employee agents to automatically generate professional PDF quotations for customers through natural language interactions. The system intelligently gathers customer requirements, retrieves current vehicle specifications and pricing from the CRM database, and generates branded quotation documents that are securely stored and shared via downloadable links.

**Problem Statement:** Sales employees currently need to manually create quotations by gathering customer information, looking up vehicle specifications, checking current pricing, and formatting documents - a time-consuming process that delays sales cycles and may contain errors.

**Solution:** An AI-powered quotation generation tool that automates the entire process from information gathering to document delivery, using conversational interactions with HITL confirmation flows to ensure accuracy while maintaining the human oversight necessary for sales transactions.

## Goals

1. **Automate Quotation Generation:** Reduce quotation creation time from hours to minutes through intelligent automation
2. **Ensure Data Accuracy:** Use real-time CRM database queries to guarantee current pricing and availability information
3. **Maintain Professional Standards:** Generate branded, professional PDF documents that meet business presentation standards
4. **Streamline Sales Process:** Integrate quotation generation seamlessly into existing sales workflows
5. **Enable Secure Sharing:** Provide secure, time-limited links for quotation sharing with customers
6. **Preserve Human Oversight:** Include confirmation steps to ensure sales employees maintain control over quotation content

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. **Natural Language Quotation Requests:** The system must accept quotation requests in natural language format (e.g., "Create a quote for Maria Garcia for 2 Honda CRVs")

2. **Intelligent Information Extraction:** The system must extract customer identifiers and vehicle requirements from conversation context to minimize redundant data entry

3. **Customer Data Retrieval:** The system must query the CRM database to find customer information using flexible search criteria (name, email, company, phone)

4. **Vehicle Specification Lookup:** The system must retrieve vehicle specifications, availability, and current pricing from the database based on requirements

5. **Missing Information Handling:** The system must request missing required information through HITL input flows when customer or vehicle data is incomplete

6. **Quotation Preview and Confirmation:** The system must present quotation details for employee review and confirmation before PDF generation

7. **Professional PDF Generation:** The system must generate branded PDF quotations using WeasyPrint with proper formatting, company branding, and professional layout

8. **Secure Document Storage:** The system must store generated PDFs in dedicated Supabase 'quotations' storage bucket (separate from RAG documents) with proper metadata and access controls

9. **Shareable Link Generation:** The system must create time-limited signed URLs for secure quotation sharing

10. **Employee Access Control:** The system must restrict quotation generation functionality to verified employees only

### Data Requirements

11. **Customer Information Integration:** The system must access customer records including name, email, phone, company, address, and business classification

12. **Vehicle Database Access:** The system must query vehicle specifications including brand, model, year, type, color, power, transmission, and stock quantities

13. **Pricing Database Integration:** The system must retrieve current pricing including base price, final price, discounts, insurance, LTO fees, warranties, and available add-ons

14. **Employee Information Access:** The system must include salesperson details in quotations including name, position, contact information, and branch details

### HITL Integration

15. **Confirmation Workflow:** The system must use existing HITL request_approval() patterns for quotation confirmation

16. **Information Collection:** The system must use request_input() patterns when additional customer or vehicle information is needed

17. **State Management:** The system must properly manage HITL state transitions and context preservation during interactive flows

### Technical Integration

18. **Database Helper Functions:** The system must use reusable database helper functions (_lookup_customer, _lookup_vehicle_by_criteria, _lookup_current_pricing, _lookup_employee_details) for data retrieval

19. **Conversation Context Extraction:** The system must use existing extract_fields_from_conversation() utility to mine previous conversation content

20. **Tool Separation:** The system must maintain clear functional separation from simple_query_crm_data tool to avoid agent confusion

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Customer Direct Access:** Customers cannot generate quotations directly - this is an employee-only tool
2. **Payment Processing:** The system will not handle payment transactions or financial processing
3. **Contract Generation:** The system will not generate legal contracts, only quotations and price estimates  
4. **Inventory Management:** The system will not modify inventory levels or reserve vehicles
5. **Email Automation:** The system will not automatically send quotations to customers - employees must share links manually
6. **Multi-language Support:** Initial version will support English/Filipino only
7. **Advanced PDF Customization:** Standard professional template only - no custom branding per quotation
8. **Approval Workflows:** No multi-level approval processes - single employee confirmation only
9. **CRM Data Modification:** The system will only read from CRM tables, not modify customer or vehicle records

## Design Considerations

### PDF Template Design

- Professional business document layout with clear sections
- Company branding including logo, colors, and contact information
- Structured information presentation: customer details, vehicle specifications, pricing breakdown, terms and conditions
- Responsive design that works well in both digital viewing and printing

### User Experience Flow

1. Employee makes quotation request in natural language
2. System extracts customer and vehicle requirements from context
3. System queries database for customer and vehicle information
4. System requests missing information if needed (HITL input flow)
5. System presents quotation preview for confirmation (HITL approval flow)
6. Upon approval, system generates PDF and provides shareable link
7. Employee receives link to share with customer

### Security Considerations

- Time-limited signed URLs (24-48 hours) for quotation access
- Secure PDF storage with proper access controls
- Employee authentication required for quotation generation
- No sensitive financial information beyond standard pricing

## Technical Considerations

### Database Architecture

- Leverage existing CRM tables: customers, vehicles, pricing, employees, branches
- Use established database connection patterns from existing tools
- Implement proper error handling and connection pooling

### PDF Generation Technology

- Async PDF generation to prevent blocking operations
- Proper font handling and professional typography

### Storage Infrastructure

- Integrate with dedicated Supabase storage bucket ('quotations') separate from RAG documents
- Follow established document upload/storage patterns
- Implement proper metadata tracking for quotation records
- Create database table for quotation tracking and audit trails

### Integration Patterns
