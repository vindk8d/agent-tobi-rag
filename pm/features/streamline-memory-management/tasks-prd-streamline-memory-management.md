# Tasks: Streamline Memory Management System

Based on the PRD for streamlining the memory management system to align with LangGraph best practices.

**Database Schema Notes:**
- Uses existing Supabase `messages` table (id, conversation_id, role, content, created_at, metadata, user_id)
- Uses existing Supabase `conversation_summaries` table (id, conversation_id, summary_text, user_id, etc.)
- LangChain role mapping: human→user, ai→assistant (compatible with existing role constraints)

**Configuration Management:**
- `EMPLOYEE_MAX_MESSAGES` (default: 12) - Message limit before summarization for employee users
- `CUSTOMER_MAX_MESSAGES` (default: 15) - Message limit before summarization for customer users  
- `SUMMARY_THRESHOLD` (default: 10) - Minimum messages required to generate conversation summary
- All thresholds configurable via environment variables or config file
