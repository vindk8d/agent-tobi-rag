  - Define customer tool access: `simple_rag` (full) + `simple_query_crm_data` (vehicles/pricing only)
  - Implement table-level filtering for customer CRM queries (block employees, opportunities, customers tables)
  - Add validation at tool execution level to enforce table restrictions
  
- [x] **1.3.3** Update existing tools for user context awareness
  - Modify `simple_rag` to work for both user types (no restrictions for customers)
  - Update `simple_query_crm_data` with table-level filtering for customers (vehicles/pricing only)

### Task 1.4: Graph Architecture Updates ✅
**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** Medium | **Dependencies:** Tasks 1.1, 1.2

- [x] **1.4.1** Update graph structure in `_build_graph()`
  - Add new agent nodes (employee_agent, customer_agent)
  - Update conditional edges from user_verification
  - Remove old employee_verification references
  
- [x] **1.4.2** Update memory management nodes

  - Maintain conversation isolation between user types
  
- [x] **1.4.3** Add graceful fallback handling
  - Create fallback response for unknown users
  - Direct unknown users to appropriate contact channels
  - Log unknown user attempts for monitoring

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Customer Messaging)

> **Architecture Decision**: Phase 2 implements a **dedicated HITL node** approach with **combined interrupt+execution** to meet PRD requirements for immediate delivery feedback. This separates HITL concerns from main agent logic while providing atomic confirmation+delivery operations within the interrupt flow.
> 
> **UPDATED Graph Structure (Cleaner Approach)**:
> ```
> employee_agent → customer_message_confirmation_and_delivery → employee_agent → END
> customer_agent → END (direct, no customer messaging capability)
> ```
> 
> **Key Benefits of Updated Structure**:
> - **Centralized Response Handling**: Employee agent manages delivery results when resumed from HITL
> - **Cleaner Execution Flow**: No confusing parallel paths to END
> - **Better State Management**: Proper cleanup of confirmation variables in employee_agent
> - **Logical Correctness**: Only employees can trigger customer messaging
> 
> **State Management Philosophy**: Following the principle of minimal state for cost-efficiency, we use only 2 essential state variables with implicit logic for routing and side effect protection, eliminating redundant flags.
> 
> **Design Principles for Future Development**:
> - **Centralized Response Handling**: All HITL operations should route back to the originating agent for result handling
> - **Implicit Routing Logic**: Use state presence (not flags) to trigger routing decisions  
> - **Clean State Management**: Originating agent responsible for state cleanup after HITL completion
> - **Logical Flow Separation**: Customers cannot trigger actions that require employee approval
> - **Single Responsibility**: Each node has one clear purpose in the conversation flow
