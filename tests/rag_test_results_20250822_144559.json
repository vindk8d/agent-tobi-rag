The documents provided information about the Ford Bronco 2024, including details about its exterior features such as the Carbonized Gray Molded-In-Color Hard Top, LED headlights, removable roof and doors, and other specifications. \n\nUnfortunately, the documents do not contain information regarding the price of the Tesla Model 3. To find the current price of the Tesla Model 3, I recommend visiting the official Tesla website or contacting a Tesla dealership for the most up-to-date pricing information.\n\n---\n**Sources:**\n\u2022 /tmp/tmp7uqwa3pg_ford_bronco_outer_banks_sasquatch.md",
