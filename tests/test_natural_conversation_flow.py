"""
Natural Conversation Flow Integration Test

This test simulates a realistic, natural conversation between a customer and agent
to validate that both extract_fields_from_conversation and collect_sales_requirements
work together seamlessly to gather information through natural dialogue.

Tests the revolutionary approach where:
1. Customers speak naturally (not answering rigid questions)
2. extract_fields_from_conversation intelligently extracts stated information
3. collect_sales_requirements uses this to avoid redundant questions
4. Progressive field collection happens through natural conversation flow
5. User experience is dramatically improved vs. robotic questioning

This represents the ultimate validation of the revolutionary conversation-aware
collection system.
