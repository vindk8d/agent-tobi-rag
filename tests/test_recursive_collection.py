"""
Tool-Managed Recursive Collection Integration Tests

Tests for the revolutionary tool-managed recursive collection system that:
1. Tools manage their own collection state (not HITL)
2. Universal LLM-powered conversation analysis eliminates redundant questions
3. Agent coordinates tool re-calling with user response integration
4. Multi-step information gathering scenarios work seamlessly
5. Collection completion detection and error handling

This validates the elimination of HITL-managed collection in favor of smarter,
tool-managed collection with intelligent conversation pre-population.
