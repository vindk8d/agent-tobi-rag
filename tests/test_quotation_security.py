Security Testing Suite for Quotation Generation and Storage

This test suite validates:
- Storage access controls and permissions
- Signed URL security and expiration
- File path sanitization and validation
- Unauthorized access prevention
- Data privacy and isolation
- Bucket security policies
- Authentication and authorization flows

Security requirements:
- Only authorized users can access quotations
- Signed URLs expire properly and cannot be extended
- File paths are sanitized to prevent directory traversal
- Storage bucket is private with proper access controls
- Customer data is isolated between employees
- Sensitive information is not exposed in URLs or errors
