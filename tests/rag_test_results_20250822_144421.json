The documents provided information about the Ford Bronco 2024, but did not include details about the pricing of the Tesla Model 3. \n\nTo find the current price of the Tesla Model 3, I recommend visiting the official Tesla website or contacting a Tesla dealership for the most up-to-date pricing information. Tesla's pricing for their vehicles can vary based on the model, features, and any current promotions or discounts available.\n\n---\n**Sources:**\n\u2022 /tmp/tmp7uqwa3pg_ford_bronco_outer_banks_sasquatch.md",
