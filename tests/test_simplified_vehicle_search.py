"""
Unit tests for simplified vehicle search system with LLM intelligence.

This module tests the _search_vehicles_with_llm() function and related components
that provide intelligent, natural language-based vehicle searching capabilities.

Test Coverage:
- Simple queries: "Toyota Prius", "Honda Civic red"
- Complex queries: "family SUV good fuel economy under 2M", "luxury sedan 2023 or newer"
- Semantic queries: "affordable family car", "fuel efficient compact", "business vehicle"
- Edge cases: typos, brand synonyms, model variations, impossible requests
- SQL safety validation and injection protection
