# Product Requirements Document: Salesperson Copilot Agent with RAG

## Introduction/Overview

The Salesperson Copilot Agent is an AI-powered assistant designed to help salespeople access consolidated information from across multiple departments (marketing, finance, operations) through a single interface. The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, real-time responses about company products, services, promotions, and inventory.

The copilot operates through a Telegram bot interface for salespeople and includes a web-based management dashboard for administrators. The system scrapes and indexes content from company websites and documents to build a comprehensive knowledge base that salespeople can query conversationally.

**Problem Statement:** Salespeople currently need to contact multiple departments or search through various systems to get information needed to close sales, leading to delays and missed opportunities.

**Solution:** A unified AI copilot that consolidates all sales-relevant information into a single, conversational interface accessible via Telegram.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Information Retrieval Time:** Decrease the time salespeople spend gathering information from multiple sources from hours to seconds
2. **Improve Sales Support:** Provide accurate, up-to-date information about products, promotions, and inventory in real-time
3. **Consolidate Data Sources:** Create a single source of truth for sales-relevant information across the organization
4. **Enhance Sales Productivity:** Enable salespeople to focus on selling rather than information gathering
5. **Ensure Data Freshness:** Maintain current information through automated daily updates from source systems

## User Stories

### Salesperson Stories
- **As a salesperson**, I want to ask "What's the latest promotion on Tesla Model 3?" so that I can provide current offers to my clients
- **As a salesperson**, I want to query "How many BMW X5s do we have in stock?" so that I can give accurate availability information to customers
- **As a salesperson**, I want the copilot to proactively suggest relevant information during our conversation so that I don't miss important details that could help close the sale
- **As a salesperson**, I want to access the copilot through Telegram so that I can get information quickly while on calls or meetings with clients
- **As a salesperson**, I want my conversation history to be preserved so that I can reference previous queries and build context over time

### Administrator Stories
- **As a sales manager**, I want to add new websites to scrape so that the copilot has access to the latest marketing materials and product information
- **As an IT admin**, I want to upload documents to the system so that internal sales materials are available to the copilot
- **As a sales manager**, I want to monitor which documents are successfully indexed so that I can ensure all relevant information is available
- **As an admin**, I want to receive alerts when websites become inaccessible so that I can address data source issues promptly

## Functional Requirements

### Core RAG System

5. The system must generate embeddings for all indexed content using OpenAI's embedding models
6. The system must store embeddings and metadata in Supabase for efficient retrieval
7. The system must use semantic search to find relevant information based on user queries

### Telegram Bot Interface
8. The system must provide a Telegram bot interface for salespeople to interact with the copilot
9. The system must respond to user queries within 3 seconds under normal conditions
10. The system must maintain conversation history and context between sessions
11. The system must support up to 100 concurrent users without performance degradation
12. The system must gracefully handle cases where no relevant information is found by stating "I don't know"
13. The system must proactively suggest relevant information when contextually appropriate

### Web Management Dashboard
14. The system must provide a web-based dashboard for administrators to manage data sources
15. The dashboard must display all indexed documents with their status (successful/failed)
16. The dashboard must show embedding quality metrics and indexing statistics
17. The dashboard must provide functionality to add new website URLs for scraping
18. The dashboard must support document upload with drag-and-drop functionality
19. The dashboard must display alerts when websites become inaccessible or fail to scrape

### Data Management
20. The system must log all user queries and responses for analysis
21. The system must log conflicting information from different sources to console for debugging purposes and inform the user that conflicting information was found and the question cannot be answered at this time
22. The system must provide source attribution for all responses
23. The system must handle website structure changes gracefully with appropriate error handling

### Technical Architecture
24. The system must use LangChain and LangGraph for agent architecture and conversation management
25. The system must integrate with LangSmith for tracing and monitoring
26. The system must use OpenAI GPT models for natural language generation
27. The system must use Supabase for data persistence and user session management
28. The frontend must be built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Multi-language Support:** Initial version will only support English
- **Content Filtering:** No content approval process for scraped data (future feature)
- **User Authentication:** No login system for the web dashboard (future feature)
- **Human-in-the-Loop Escalation:** No escalation paths to human experts (future feature)
- **Mobile App:** Only Telegram bot interface, no dedicated mobile application
- **Role-based Access Control:** No territory or product-specific data filtering for salespeople
- **Real-time Website Monitoring:** No immediate alerts for website changes (daily refresh only)
- **Advanced Analytics:** No detailed usage analytics or sales performance correlation (future feature)

## Design Considerations

### Frontend Dashboard
- **Framework:** Next.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern UI
- **Layout:** Single-page application with sidebar navigation
- **Color Scheme:** Professional blue/white theme consistent with business applications
- **Components:** Document upload area, data source management table, status indicators, alert notifications
- **Responsive Design:** Desktop-optimized (primary users are administrators at workstations)

### Telegram Bot UX
- **Conversational Flow:** Natural language interface with quick response buttons for common queries
- **Message Format:** Structured responses with clear source attribution
- **Error Handling:** Friendly error messages with suggestions for alternative queries
- **Proactive Suggestions:** Context-aware recommendations presented as optional buttons

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Backend:** Python-based microservices using FastAPI
- **Agent Framework:** LangChain for RAG pipeline, LangGraph for conversation management
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) with vector extensions for embeddings
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI GPT-4 for generation, text-embedding-3-large for embeddings
- **Monitoring:** LangSmith for agent tracing and performance monitoring
- **Message Queue:** Redis for handling concurrent Telegram bot requests
- **Web Scraping:** BeautifulSoup4 with Playwright for dynamic content

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** <3 seconds for 95% of queries
- **Concurrent Users:** Support 100 simultaneous Telegram conversations
- **Data Refresh:** Complete daily refresh of all sources within 4-hour maintenance window
- **Uptime:** 99.5% availability during business hours

### Security Considerations
- **API Security:** Rate limiting on Telegram bot endpoints
